# Instagram Profile Picture Downloader

* __Author__ : Rishav Das

The script for downloading instagram profile pictures. The tool is currently a CLI script, we will update the GUI version of the tool.

## Requirements

The script does not requires any other external requirements, just the python3 should be installed.

## Usage

To download profile picture of an instagram user with username, lets say _rdofficial192_ we will use the command :
```
python3 main.py rdofficial192
```
Note that the command must be executed under the folder containing the _main.py_ file. We can also call the script directly and then we can enter the required details when the script asks for.
